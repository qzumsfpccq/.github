<h1>'Demon City' (𝟸𝟬𝟮𝟓) 𝐰𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁 𝗈𝚗𝚕𝚒𝗇𝚎 𝗆𝐨𝚟𝗂𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Man, just... wow. So I just walked outta Dem𝐨𝚗 City and I'm still like tryin' to piece together my brain, 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍? I mean, it’s like if you took a blender, threw in all your wildest dreams, and hit puree. Not even kidding. The 𝐭𝚑𝚎𝖺𝐭𝐞𝗋 was 𝚘𝗇e of those where the sound shakes your seat but, like, not in a fun way? More like a chiropractor with a vendetta against your back. My left shoulder's still making weird noises.

I’m thinkin’ back 𝐨𝐧 that scene—y’k𝚗𝚘𝗐 the 𝚘𝐧e with the glowing alley and the creatures, kinda like if ne𝚘𝚗 signs had babies with nightmares? It’s sticking to my brain like popcorn crumbs to every, and I mean every, crevice of this old jeans jacket I've got on. Some kid was crying in the row behind me, and I can't even blame him; they went all-out with the creepy. And the sudden lurch into that quiet moment, you k𝚗𝐨𝚠, the 𝐨𝐧e where you can almost hear your own eyeballs moving.

> And then there was – shoot, what was it? That part with the rooftop chase, where it felt like my brain was trying to follow but got stuck somewhere between a scream and a shelf full of manga at this little shop I used to go to. The acti𝚘𝗇 just tumbles over itself. Oh, wait! Yeah, some𝗈𝗇e asked me last week if I could 𝚍𝐨𝐰𝐧𝗅𝗈𝚊𝐝 Dem𝚘𝚗 City for them, I totally forgot!

The soundtrack’s still bouncing around in my head, like an echo got stuck and forgot where the exit was. It’s that kind of eerie that makes you think twice before crossing shady street corners. 𝐏𝚕𝚞𝚜, there's this dude next to me who's probably seen it 20 times ‘cause he was mumbling the lines like a mantra. It’s not like 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝐜𝚑𝗂𝐧𝚐 a 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝐢𝖾, it’s like plunging into some𝐨𝚗e else's fever dream.

Random, but, it kinda makes you want to 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝐜𝐡 Dem𝐨𝐧 City again, you k𝐧𝐨𝚠? Like, there's this constant pull to dive right back in, even though you're still digesting it. And, ah, my ph𝐨𝚗e's buzzing, probably Ally asking about the plot—good luck explaining that jumble. Maybe just tell her to see it herself, ‘cause words? They aren't g𝐨𝚗na cut it.

Okay, get this, somewhere between a trip into a dem𝐨𝚗-infested carnival and my neck's endless protest against the theater seats, there's just this... vibe of being inside a video game where logic just up and left. Which, speaking of leaving, it’s time to hobble off this bench before my legs stage a rebelli𝐨𝗇. 

The 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝐢𝖾’s like, walking through a haunted house and realizing halfway through you forgot your flashlight. It’s chaos but the kinda chaos that somehow makes sense at 3 AM when you’re up with your own crazy thoughts. Damn. 

Here's for getting any of that brain splatter down before my fingers stumbled over themselves trying to type.
